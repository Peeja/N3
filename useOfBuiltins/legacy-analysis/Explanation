The current statistics takes the rule sets into account as used in the paper 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826819300241 -
with the difference that we used the latest version of eye files 
from here: https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning - 
and the rule set of Cwm.

As far as they are publicly available, the datasets can be accessed at:

orca: not public, I check whether I am allowed to change that

eye: https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning
cwm: https://github.com/linkeddata/swap




I used a very simple bash script which checks for the occurences of builtins in all files
(assuming they all use the same prefix declaration). If you add links of datasets you'd like to include below, I will ass the statistics 
for these datasets. I also plan to make the script publicly available.
